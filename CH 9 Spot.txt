9.3 Showing all users

In this section, we’ll add the penultimate user action, the index action, which is designed to display 
all the users instead of just one. Along the way, we’ll learn about populating the database with 
sample users and paginating the user output so that the index page can scale up to display a 
potentially large number of users. A mockup of the result—users, pagination links, and a “Users” 
navigation link—appears in Figure 9.7.5 In Section 9.4, we’ll add an administrative interface to the 
user index so that (presumably troublesome) users can be destroyed.
